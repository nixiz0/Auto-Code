# Auto-Code

Project allowing to **self-correct** a code generated or imported in **python**, the software  create an environment according to the libraries you use automatically and try to run your script, if there is an error then the error is integrated into an **LLM** which will find, **correct** and **return the corrected code**.


## Installation

Run the **start-app.bat** and it will automatically install the application.

5-/ You can modify the code generated on the editor (don't forget to save your modification)

6-/ You can enter other prompt to modify the code generated

7-/ If you want a new topic, you click on 'New' button to start a new conversation and code generation

8-/ If you want to seen old code generated and conversation you can click on the selectbox history and click on the conversation you want to review (you can change the code language at the top of the page to have synthaxic coloring according to the generated code)
